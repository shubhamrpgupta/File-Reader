# File-Reader

This is my one of minor project, file-reader takes an excel file for an input. The excel file consist data of employees for any given time or date. File reader extract the data and convert it into JSON file.
After that it give the info of that particular employee on that particular date who has worked more than 14 hours in a single shift.
